# Odoo_Purchase_Approval_Workflow

## Approval Workflows in Business
In most organizations, certain activities (like financial transactions, procurement, hiring, access to data, or project changes) require **authorization** before they can proceed. This is managed through an **approval workflow** — a structured process that ensures requests are reviewed and approved (or rejected) by the right people, depending on **business rules** and **user privileges**.

### **Example: Purchase Order (PO) Approval**
- A **purchase order** is a formal request to buy goods or services.
- Approval levels depend on:
    1. **Amount involved** – e.g.
        - Manager can approve up to $5,000
        - Director up to $50,000
        - CFO required above $50,000
    2. **User privileges/role** – not every employee can approve or initiate a purchase.
    3. **Business rules** – e.g., IT equipment requests may require both Finance and IT approval.

**Typical flow:**
1. Employee creates a PO request.
2. System routes it to the appropriate manager based on the rules.
3. If within approval limit, manager approves → request goes to procurement.
4. If above their limit, request is escalated to higher authority.
5. Once fully approved, procurement executes the order.

### **Why This Workflow is Needed**
1. **Internal Controls & Compliance**
    - Prevents fraud, errors, or unauthorized spending.
    - Ensures compliance with laws, regulations, and audit requirements.
2. **Accountability & Transparency**
    - Clear record of who approved what and when.
    - Makes it easier to track responsibility in case of disputes.
3. **Risk Management**
    - Protects the organization from financial and reputational risk.    
    - Sensitive processes (e.g., large expenses, data access) require oversight.    
4. **Efficiency & Standardization**
    - Automates routine approvals to save time.
    - Ensures consistent application of company policies.    
5. **Strategic Control**
    - Management can control budgets, prioritize spending, and align with strategic goals.
